# Nate's Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to year 2022 of [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I will be using R for my solutions, and using tjmahr's excellent
package [aoc](https://github.com/tjmahr/aoc), which uses an R package project structure for organising solutions to advent of code.

I like to use R is because it is the language I'm most familiar with. 

Using an R package structure may seem a bit overkill, but by using it we get a lot of really nice features for free such as automatically downloading 
puzzle inputs, generating file templates, and functions for testing which are useful for making sure your code doesn't break when modifying previous 
solutions; I will generally try to optimise solutions after I've solved them because my first attempts are often pretty messy.
